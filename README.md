# CUBA Platform Component - Console

This application component is a Groovy console for interactive runtime application management and debugging of a [CUBA](https://www.cuba-platform.com/) application.
It is based on the idea of the [Grails console](http://plugins.grails.org/plugin/console).

## What is it about?
Sometimes it is necessary for debugging purposes of a CUBA application to be able to execute code that supports developer and customer support to get insights in the running application.

The console uses the [Scripting](https://doc.cuba-platform.com/manual-6.4/scripting.html) Interface of the platform in order to execute groovy code.
